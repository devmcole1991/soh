Database Set Up Procedure: 

Includes PHP for making database (might not work) or you can simply import the sql files into an existing database (create new sealofhealth database and then import). Also includes a logout file that wasnt uploaded before. If you want to test sign in and login, enter your information. Next, check the database table, users, to make sure your account was successfully added. Now, write some SQL code to authenticate your account. To do this, type out "UPDATE users SET userStatus = 'Y';" and execute the code without the quotations. You should be able to log on now.
